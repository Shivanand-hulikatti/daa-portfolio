        <h3>➡ What are the kinds of problems we see in the nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</h3>
        
        <p><strong>A: Iteration:</strong> Problems we see in the nature are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ants repeatedly explore paths, leaving their trails that make to find efficient route (Optimization from Algorithms Portfolio)</li>
            <li>Seasons change as weather alternates between heating and cooling, reflecting nature's iterative process</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>B: Backtracking:</strong></p>
        <p>It involves exploring solutions by trying paths and Leaving the hard(difficult/unuse) ones Many animals use backtracking for Searching for food and finding the optimal route to reach their house quick by escaping predators Maze - where you retrace your path and try alternative routes when hitting a dead end</p>

        <p><strong>Recursion:</strong> Divide and Conquer (merge sort huh?): Natural phenomena like river branching or root systems, which divide into smaller parts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <h3>➡ What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth</h3>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> measures the time required to execute an algorithm and represents the number of basic operations performed by an algorithm</p>
            <p><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> measures the memory(storage) required by an algorithm, for tracking how much memory is the input size and determining how much additional memory is needed to solve a problem</p>
        </div>

        <p>A good algorithm executes quickly and saves space in the process. we should find a good medium of space and time (space and time complexity). In the world of computer science to become a good engineer, we need to write algorithms that are time efficient and use less memory. It should be resource optimized, solving larger problems with limited computing power and giving Impact on users experience and system performance</p>

        <h4>Complexity Classes and Orders of Growth:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(1) - Constant Time:</span> It has fixed runtime regardless of input size Examples: Array access, simple arithmetic operations</li>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:</span> its Runtime grows logarithmically Examples: Tree operations</li>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(n) - Linear Time:</span> Runtime grows linearly with input size Examples: Linear search</li>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time:</span> Efficient sorting algorithms Examples: Merge sort, heap sort</li>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(n²) - Quadratic Time:</span> Time grows with the square of the input size. Examples: Bubble sort, simple nested loops</li>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time:</span> Runtime doubles with each input addition Examples: Recursive Fibonacci, brute-force</li>
            <li><span class="complexity">O(n!) - Factorial Time:</span> Extremely inefficient Examples: Traveling salesman problem (brute force)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Visualization of Growth Rates Copy:<br>
        O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(2ⁿ) < O(n!)</p>

        <p>we generally choose algorithms with lower complexity classes looking between time and space efficiency and optimize based on specific problem constraints</p>
